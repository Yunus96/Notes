# Notes
This repository contains notes I took when using diverse tools and reading IT-related articles, over the last 2 years.

It should give a good idea of what I can work with, although it is primarly intended for my own usage. This includes notably:

## Languages
* Node JS
* Python
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
